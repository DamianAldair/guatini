# Guatiní

App for Guatini Project

## Abstract

The “Guatiní” project arose as an extension project, with the purpose of instilling in the new generations, above all, knowledge about the cuban birds and the importance of caring for the environment.

After several exercises of professional practices and diploma thesis of students of “Universidad Tecnológica de La Habana José Antonio Echeverría, CUJAE”, applications have been developed to serve as “multimedia” about cuban endemic birds.

The main objective is to increase the scope of the project, removing the current limit of having only endemic birds of Cuba and giving the possibility of including information of all species.
